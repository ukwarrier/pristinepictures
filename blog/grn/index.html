					Grow Greens! Regardless of your being or not being an ecobuff or having a specific eco objective, you can benefit from the healthier and economical aspects of munching green - not just to save a few dimes, but to please your tummy as well. With increased migration to cities, and growing work-life imbalance, people are often made to compromise on organic or quality foods. This very situation inspired many to experiment by exploiting low-tech cultivation techniques to grow crops such as baby greens and microgreens.

						Most of microgreen varieties are ready to harvest in less than 15 days.

					Green balcony, vegetated balcony or eco balcony call it whatever you want to call - the primary objective, however, is to escape the over contaminated, highly deceptive veggie business by growing healthier organic greens. If you are on a tight budget and need surprising workaround for your daily supply of greens, microgreens are just right for you. Short growing cycle, limited space requirements and negligible investment has made them a popular choice for urban (balcony) farms.

				<p>
					Microgreens are a tad bit longer than sprouts, usually harvested at 2-3 inches. Most of them super-flavor at this stage than when they mature as plants. This stage is considered as the right fit for garnishes and salads. You can grow microgreens from the seeds of most salad greens or vegetable, pulses such as Amaranthus, Moong, Mustard, Pea, Radish, Bamboo shoots, Broccoli etc.

					You can use standard plastic nursery trays or any spare trays or paint buckets, spreading them out in your balcony or backyard. Most small growers use soil in the trays - you can use either cocopeat or coir pith instead. You first need to saw the seeds in covered trays until germination. You then move them to a place where they receive reasonable amount of sunlight. That allows them to pickup speed to reach a fair harvesting size. Most of microgreen varieties are ready to harvest in less than 15 days.

					Here are a few quick tips for your DIY setup
				</h3>
				<p>
					<br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />1. Shallow Planter<br />2. Cocopeat (known as coir pith as well)<br />3. Seeds to grow<br />4. Bottle sprayer<br /><br />EFFORT<br /><br />1. Clean up the shallow tray<br />2. Fill it up with cocopeat (you may use vermicompost or enriched soil to enhance the growth)<br />3. Spray water enough to wet the contents - make sure that you do not overload water<br />4. Saw the seeds in covered trays until germination.<br />5. Move them to a place where they get reasonable amount of sunlight - that allows them to pickup speed to reach a fair harvesting size.<br /><br />RESULT<br />Your very own Greens!<br />Most of microgreen varieties are ready to harvest in less than 15 days. Harvest the crop in the same morning you want to cook so that you can carry the freshness to platter.

					WORDS OF WISDOM
				</h3>
				<p>
					1. <strong>Neither thick nor thin</strong> - Always spread out the seeds so that it doesn&rsquo;t grow too thick. Denser crop is susceptible to rot. Though it will not cause any trouble, planting thin makes small, scraggly crop.<br />2. <strong>Water Supply</strong> - Keep the medium reasonably soggy throughout the lifecycle. Lookout for signs of wilting and provide enough water for the roots to absorb the right mix of oxygen and water. Rot is very likely a sign of over-watering - so review your watering schedules. Spraying just enough water morning and evening is ideal.<br />3. <strong>Tray Story</strong> - You may use one tray for different crops because the harvesting times for all the crops might be similar - but remember not to crowd the tray.<br />4. <strong>Soak it up Dude</strong> - There are seeds that fare better when soaked. Read up the net for more information.<br />5. <strong>Smelly Greens</strong> - It isn&rsquo;t surprising if it tend to offend your nostrils a bit. A mild odor is expected when the crop crosses 10 days or so. So you have a reason to harvest ;)<br />6. <strong>Hot &rsquo;n&rsquo; Cold</strong> - While a cold climate or environment slows down the growth, a bit of warming can get them up to speed.
